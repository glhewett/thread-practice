# Thread Practice

This project is just a bit of fiddling that helped me to understand how to use the standard libraries' threading functionality.  I am just trying on a small scale before I apply it to a larger project.


## Build

1. Clone Repo
2. Build by using the `make` command.
3. Run the resulting program using the command `./threading-practice`
